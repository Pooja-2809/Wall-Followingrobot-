I developed this wall Follower robot using webots software

--What Is Webots?
Webots is a professional mobile robot simulation software package. It offers a rapid prototyping environment that allows the user to create 3D virtual worlds with physics properties such as mass, joints, friction coefficients, etc. The user can add simple passive objects or active objects called mobile robots. These robots can have different locomotion schemes (wheeled robots, legged robots, or flying robots). Moreover, they may be equipped with a number of sensor and actuator devices, such as distance sensors, drive wheels, cameras, motors, touch sensors, emitters, receivers, etc. Finally, the user can program each robot individually to exhibit the desired behavior. Webots contains a large number of robot models and controller program examples to help users get started.

--About e-puck:-
E-puck is a miniature mobile robot originally developed at EPFL for teaching purposes by the designers of the successful Khepera robot. The hardware and software of e-puck is fully open source, providing low level access to every electronic device and offering unlimited extension possibilities.
The model includes support for the differential wheel motors (encoders are also simulated, as position sensors), the infra-red sensors for proximity and light measurements, the Accelerometer, the Gyro, the Camera, the 8 surrounding LEDs, the body and front LEDs, bluetooth communication (modeled using Emitter / Receiver devices) and ground sensors extension.
